Machine Learning Models;http://www.packtpub.com/books/content/machine-learning-models;In this article by Pratap Dangeti , the author of the book Statistics for Machine Learning , we will take a look at ridge regression and lasso regression in machine learning. (For more resources related to this topic, see here .) Ridge regression and lasso regression In linear regression only residual sum of squares ( RSS ) are minimized, whereas in ridge and lasso regression, penalty applied (also known as shrinkage penalty ) on coefficient values to regularize the coefficients with the tuning parameter ? . When ?=0  penalty has no impact, ridge/lasso produces the same result as linear regression, whereas ? => ? will bring coefficients to zero. read more;"<p>In this article by <strong>Pratap Dangeti</strong>, the author of the book <a href=""https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/statistics-machine-learning"">Statistics for Machine Learning</a>, we will take a look at ridge regression and lasso regression in machine learning.</p> <p><em>(For more resources related to this topic, see <a href=""#more"">here</a>.)</em></p> Ridge regression and lasso regression <p>In linear regression only <strong>residual sum of squares</strong> (<strong>RSS</strong>) are minimized, whereas in ridge and lasso regression, penalty applied (also known as <strong>shrinkage penalty</strong>) on coefficient values to regularize the coefficients with the tuning parameter <em>&lambda;</em>.</p> <p>When <em>&lambda;=0&nbsp;</em>penalty has no impact, ridge/lasso produces the same result as linear regression, whereas <em>&lambda; =&gt; &infin;</em> will bring coefficients to zero.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.packtpub.com/books/content/machine-learning-models"">read more</a></p>";;-3ae31407-484cbcc2;16/08/17 08:24
